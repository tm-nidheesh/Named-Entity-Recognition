Overview 
This project is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system designed to identify and classify named entities in text data. Named Entity Recognition is a subtask of information extraction that aims to locate and classify entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc.

Features 
1. Pretrained Models: Utilizes pretrained models (e.g., BERT, SpaCy) for NER tasks. 
2. Customization: Allows customization of the NER model with additional training data.
3. Evaluation: Provides evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Visualization: Supports visualization of named entities in text.

Applications: 
1. Information Extraction: Extract relevant information from large volumes of unstructured text data for analysis and decision-making.
2. Entity Linking: Link recognized named entities to corresponding entries in knowledge bases or databases for additional information retrieval.
3. Document Classification: Use named entities as features for document classification tasks such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling.

By developing and deploying a Named Entity Recognition system, the project aims to facilitate efficient information extraction and analysis from unstructured text data, enabling a wide range of NLP applications and use cases.
